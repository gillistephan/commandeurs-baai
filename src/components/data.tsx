		text: `From a young age as an ‘Arubiano’, I grew up sharing with and caring for our sister island of Curaçao/Corsou, via renowned Aruban swimmer, Roly Bisslik’s ‘Aruba Dolphins Swimming Club,’ sharing the sport with brothers from ‘De Dolfijnen’ en also with ‘Sithoc,’ both from Curaçao. Later with the late renowned Aruban tennis coach, Eddy Ras with brothers and sisters from SOV Asiento of Curaçao and the T.I.H.T.A. international tennis tournament on Aruba. During a total of 17,5 years living in the Netherlands, the love for Curaçao as an ‘Arubiano’ grew considerably knowing, meeting, sharing live and love with brothers and sisters from Curaçao. We remember, the University of Groningen, the streets of Groningen, De Zolder, Troubadour, Rumba,
		IKEA, De Drie Gezusters, The Glory and De Oosterpoort (all in Groningen), Uilenstede, Easy Times,
		Caprice, Heineken Music Hall and Pepsi Stage (all the last in Amsterdam), and Masjid Al-Oemmah (Den Haag), which were venues where the halls and walls have many bridge building stories to tell, between me as an ‘Arubiano’ and and the ‘Yiu di Corsou.’ Speaking your native tongue in another
		country makes people feel at home.
		
		Back on my native island of Aruba, the relationship continues, where the passed shaped to present, which on its turn shapes the future. In 1988, Mr. Roly Bisslik swam from Venezuela to Aruba, inspiring, 5 swimmers, Davy Bisslik, Stephan Thijsen, Romar Arendsz, Deaxo Croes and Wendy Kock-Croes, to perform this long distance swimming again.
		This has inspired me as Romar Arendsz’ and Angelo Kock as Davy Bisslik’s kayak riders to go for more in kayaking as well as Deaxo Crores in swimming.
		
		Mr. Roly Bisslik happened to inspire our brother from Curaçao, Ryan de Jongh, long distance kayaker as well, to cover more maritime distances. On his turn, Ryan, is currently serving as the motivator, inspirator and trendsetter for us as ‘Arubianos’ in the endeavour of covering more maritime distances.
		
		Except reasons for personal life experience enhancement by kayaking, the next trajectory from Playa Kalki, Curaçao to Serene by the Sea at Savaneta, Aruba on the 4th of September, there is the main reason, which is to raise awareness to the preservation of our natural aspects of our islands, especially mangroves and the marine life surrounding these, wherever we can and in this case in the Commandeursbaai. The last is the old name for the town of Savaneta, which is the cradle of both Angelo Kock and me. A third reason for me to do this is to live the inter island inspiration of the past, connected to the present, where inter island inspirations, connectivities and growth among the people are given the chance to flourish.
		
		We, people from small island states, are more than eager to push our individual and collective potentials, to the advantage to our ‘dushi’ Caribbean islands of Aruba and Curaçao, by performing
		intergenerational and inspirational challenges.`,

		text: "I only discovered nature 4 years ago, when I joined Ryan de Jongh in his  quest to conserve and to protect the Mangrove of Curacao.  Maybe the word 'respect' is better used. I did knew a lot about nature, and the way we as human we mistreathing nature, destroying it. I knew what we all, including me should not be doing in nature or towards nature, so that we could preserve that what we had. But it was not until I started hanging out with Ryan, when he took me on kayaking, that I truly began to understand out impact on nature. Now I am a fervent kayaker. who wants to use his ability to kayak long distances to draw attention to the cause of nature. September 4th I will be kayaking together with Ryan, Stefanie and two others kayakers form Aruba, departing form Playa Kalki Curacao, to Commandeursbaai Aruba. Our cause? The persvation of the mangroves in Aruba. Please donate to this cause.",
